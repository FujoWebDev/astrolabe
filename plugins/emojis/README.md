# @fujocoded/astrolabe-emoji

Emoji plugin that can load emoji sets (`com.fujocoded.astrolabe.emojiset`) from a PDS.

## TODO:

- Don't load all emojis all together
- Write adapters that translate to fallback visualization for unsupported formats
- Get correct address of PDS with record rather than hardcoding Ms Boba's
- Write actual Lexicon and type this well
- Ideally also write code for emoji picker from set
- Augment emoji hover with extra data from records (e.g. description, credits, original set)
- Print attributes in actual outputted HTML
