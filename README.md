# Boba Editor Next

Next-generation editor for BobaBoard (and beyond). Still in experimental phase.

## Run Locally

### Regular development

```bash
  yarn run storybook
```

### Output Inspector Storybook extensions

Build extension

Run Storybook without manager cache, to pick up the changes. This is only necessary the first time after compilation.

yarn run storybook --no-manager-cache
```
